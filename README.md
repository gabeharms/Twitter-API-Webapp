### Project Description
This Rails project was created in one days time as a coding challenge from a potential employer. It is designed to allow a user to sign in on my website with twitter. After doing so, the user is presented with all their twitter information. Additionally, at the bottom of the screen, the user is allowed to search twitter for specific tweets. After searching for tweets, the app also allows the user to sort by time, type, and location of the tweet. The app also automatically gathers the location of the app user by translating their IP address.
